<p>Creaking floors, chips crunching and even loud breathing - these common daily noises can be distracting factors for people with a high IQ. Scientists from the University of Helsinki conducted a study which showed a strong connection between the ability of a person to find unconventional solutions to problems and the inability to ignore ambient noise.</p>

<p>Studies show that night owls and those who wake up later actually are smarter and more creative than their early rising counterparts. ... The reason for all these differences is likely due to the difference in brain chemistry between late night creative types and early morning larks</p>

<p>Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high-flavanol cocoa for five days improved blood flow to the brain ( 20 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in elderly people with mental impairment</p>

<p> When consumed in moderation, coffee can be very good for yourbrain. In the short-term, it may improve mood, vigilance, learning and reaction time. Long-term use may protect againstbrain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.</p>

<p>Addiction is a complex issue that has multiple influences, including intelligence. Many specialists have considered the connection between addiction and intelligence, trying to gauge how they are related. The results of various studies have been surprising: high intelligence has been more commonly linked to addiction, rather than low intelligence. </p>

<p>Smart people are able to manage impulsivity and they’re good at suppressing emotions. They also think of consequences before they start doing something.</p>
<h4>03.YOU'RE TOO CURIOUS</h4>

<p>Recent studies show that part of the reason we are curious is that novel things are stimulating and make us want to know more. But curiosity and asking questions can also be part of an organized strategy to learn and grow more in the name of progress.</p>
<h4>02.YOU'RE LAZY</h4>

<p>If you are the eldest child, your chances of being more intelligent is higher compared to your younger siblings. This is not because of genetics, but rather due to psychological factors. According to several studies, the first-born was found to have a higher IQ, an average of about 2 to 3 points better, than their younger siblings. </p>
